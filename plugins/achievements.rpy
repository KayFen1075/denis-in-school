## Achievements for Ren'Py by Feniks (feniksdev.itch.io / feniksdev.com)
##
################################################################################
## This file contains code for an achievement system in Ren'Py. It is designed
## as a wrapper to the built-in achievement system, so it hooks into the
## Steam backend as well if you set up your achievement IDs the same as in
## the Steam backend.
##
## You don't have to register the achievements or anything with the backend,
## or worry about syncing - that's all automatically done for you when the
## achievements are declared and granted.
##
## To get started, declare a few achievements below. Some samples are included.
## You may also replace the `image locked_achievement` image with something
## appropriate - this image is used as the default "Locked" image for all your
## achievements unless you specify something else.
##
## Then you can make a button to go to your achievement gallery screen, e.g.
# textbutton _("Achievements") action ShowMenu("achievement_gallery")
## This will show the achievement gallery screen, declared below. You can
## further customize it however you like.
## If you click on an achievement in the gallery during development (this will
## not happen in a release build), it will toggle the achievement on/off.
## This will also let you see the achievement popup screen, similarly declared
## below. It can be customized however you like.
##
## If you use this code in your projects, credit me as Feniks @ feniksdev.com
##
## Leave a comment on the tool page on itch.io or an issue on the GitHub
## if you run into any issues.

################################################################################
## CONFIGURATION
################################################################################
## This is a configuration value which determines whether the in-game
## achievement popup should appear when Steam is detected. Since Steam
## already has its own built-in popup, you may want to set this to False
## if you don't want to show the in-game popup alongside it.
## The in-game popup will still work on non-Steam builds, such as builds
## released DRM-free on itch.io.
define myconfig.INGAME_POPUP_WITH_STEAM = True
## The length of time the in-game popup spends hiding itself (see
## transform achievement_popout below).
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_HIDE_TIME = 1.0
## True if the game should show in-game achievement popups when an
## achievement is earned. You can set this to False if you just want an
## achievement gallery screen and don't want any popups.
define myconfig.SHOW_ACHIEVEMENT_POPUPS = True
## This can be set to a sound that plays when the achievement popup appears.
## None does not play a sound.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_SOUND = None # "audio/sfx/achievement.ogg"
## If the sound plays, this sets the channel it will play on. The audio
## channel plays on the sfx mixer, and can play overlapping sounds if multiple
## achievements are earned at once.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_CHANNEL = "audio"

## A callback, or list of callbacks, which are called when an achievement
## is granted. It is called with one argument, the achievement which
## was granted. It is only called if the achievement has not previously
## been earned. See the README for more information.
define myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_CALLBACK = [
    ## This first example is an achievement which unlocks after two other
    ## achievements have been granted ("hidden_achievement" and
    ## "hidden_description").
    LinkedAchievement(hidden3=['hidden_achievement', 'hidden_description']),
    ## The second example is an achievement which unlocks after all achievements
    ## have been granted. This is a special case.
    LinkedAchievement(platinum_achievement='all'),
]

init python:
    ## This is a built-in configuration value. It will set the position of
    ## the Steam popup. You can change this to any of the following:
    ## "top_left", "top_right", "bottom_left", "bottom_right"
    ## You may want to use this to ensure any Steam notifications don't conflict
    ## with the position of the built-in notification, if you're using both.
    achievement.steam_position = None

################################################################################
## DEFINING ACHIEVEMENTS
################################################################################
## Replace this with whatever locked image you want to use as the default
## for a locked achievement.
image locked_achievement = Text("?")

## Example 1 ###################################################################
## This is how you declare achievements. You will use `define` and NOT
## `default`, so you can update the achievements later (you wouldn't want the
## description to be tied to a specific save file, for example).
## The order you declare achievements in is the order they will appear in the
## achievement gallery, by default.

## You can grant an achievement in-game with `$ sample_achievement.grant()`

## Example 2 ###################################################################
# define progress_achievement = Achievement(
    # name=_("Progress Achievement"),
    # id="progress_achievement",
    # description=_("This is an achievement with a progress bar."),
    # unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=InvertMatrix()),
    ## To record progress, you need to specify a stat_max. This means you can
    ## show a progress bar with % completion towards the achievement. It is
    ## useful if, for example, you have an achievement counting how many
    ## chapters the player has completed which unlocks when they have seen all
    ## the chapters.
    # stat_max=12,
    ## You can also provide a stat_modulo, which means the achievement is only
    ## updated in the Steam backend every time the stat reaches a multiple of
    ## the modulo.
    ## Alternatively, this system also lets you set stat_update_percent instead,
    ## so if you want it to update every 10% it progresses, you can set
    # stat_update_percent=10
    ## This is most useful for achievements with a large number of steps,
    ## like a general % completion achievement. Maybe there are 600 things to
    ## complete for the achievement, but obviously 0.1% increments are pretty
    ## meaningless so you can either set stat_modulo=6 or stat_update_percent=1
    ## and it will update Steam every 6 steps or every 1%.
# )
## To update progress towards completion of this achievement, you can use
# $ progress_achievement.add_progress(1)
## where 1 is how much progress is added to the stat (so, the first time it
## is called for the above example it'd be 1/12, the second it'd be 2/12, etc).
##
## Alternatively, you can directly set the progress like:
# $ progress_achievement.progress(5)
## This will directly set progress to 5, making the above example 5/12 for
## example. This can be useful if you're doing something like using a set to
## track unique progress towards the achievement e.g.
# $ persistent.seen_endings.add("end1")
# $ ending_achievement.progress(len(persistent.seen_endings))
## This will prevent the achievement from being added to multiple times if the
## player sees the same ending multiple times.

## Example 3 ###################################################################
## This achievement is "hidden", that is, its name and description appear as
## ??? in the achievement gallery until it is unlocked.
# define hidden_achievement = Achievement(
    # name=_("Hidden Achievement"),
    # id="hidden_achievement",
    # description=_("This hidden achievement hides both the name and description."),
    # unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=BrightnessMatrix(-1.0)),
    # hidden=True, ## The important bit that hides the name and description
# )

## Example 4 ###################################################################
# define hidden_description = Achievement(
#     name=_("Hidden Description"),
#     id="hidden_description",
#     description=_("This hidden achievement hides only the description."),
#     unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=SepiaMatrix()),
#     hide_description=True, ## The important bit that hides only the description
# )

## Example 5 ###################################################################
## This achievement unlocks automatically when the other two hidden achievements
## are unlocked. This is set up via myconfig.ACHIEVEMENT_CALLBACK earlier in
## the file.
# define hidden_double_unlock = Achievement(
    # name=_("You found it"),
    # id="hidden3",
    # description=_("This achievement unlocks automatically when the other two hidden achievements are unlocked."),
    # unlocked_image=Transform("gui/window_icon.png", matrixcolor=ContrastMatrix(0.0)),
    # hidden=True,
    # Besides just setting hide_description=True to set it to "???", you can
    # optionally provide your own custom description here, which is only
    # shown until the achievement is unlocked.
    # hide_description=_("Try unlocking the other two hidden achievements before this one."),
# )
## Example 6 ###################################################################
## This -2 makes sure it's declared before the other achievements. This is
## so it shows up first in the list even though it's defined all the way down
## here.


################################################################################
## SCREENS
################################################################################
## POPUP SCREEN
################################################################################
## A screen which shows a popup for an achievement the first time
## it is obtained. You may modify this however you like.
## The relevant information is:
## a.name = the human-readable name of the achievement
## a.description = the description
## a.unlocked_image = the image of the achievement, now that it's unlocked
## a.timestamp = the time the achievement was unlocked at
screen achievement_popup(a, tag, num):

        add a.unlocked_image:
            ## Make sure the image is within a certain size. Useful because
            ## often popups are smaller than the full gallery image.

            ## its dimensions.

## the screen and bounces it slightly into place, then does the
## reverse when the achievement is hidden.
transform achievement_popout():

    ## The `on hide, replaced` event occurs when the screen is hidden.
    on hide, replaced:

        ## achievements at once.
